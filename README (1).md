# Flam Research Intern Task - Dummy Submission

## Implemented Features:
- Basic Android camera integration using `TextureView`
- JNI bridge from Java to native C++
- Placeholder for OpenCV Canny Edge Detection in C++
- Placeholder OpenGL rendering class

## Notes:
This is a modular project following Flamâ€™s structure:
- `/app` for Android logic
- `/jni` for native C++ processing
- `/gl` for rendering logic

This implementation logs frame processing but skips actual image rendering.

## Setup Instructions:
- Open in Android Studio
- NDK should be installed
- Project will log dummy processing actions to Logcat

**This is a simulation of architecture and JNI flow.**
